# Compilation & Implementation 
- This section has mainly two points:
1) what things are needed to understand for generating solution?
2) which files are needed  in our usecase and where can we find after generating solution?

## Generating solution

### Enviornment varaibale
- Third party Libraries and their location 

### Compilation  version 

- All code should be compiled targeting the `x64` architecture and using the `Release` configuration.  

### Generating intermediate and final solution files

#### Intermediate Solution Files

#### Final installer 
- Open the file in folder `FSTI_installer` called `FSTI_Installer.sln` in visual studio. 
- Look in the solution explorer section for `FSTI_Installer`. It will generate file `.msi` and `.exe` file. 
- Right click over that and go to `view`.
- Inside View click on `file system`.
